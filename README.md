# Python Machine Learning Jupyter Notebooks

### Jupyter notebooks containing sample usage of various algorithms using scikit-learn.

### Prerequisite
We require **Python 3.9** with **Pipenv** and **Git** installed. 
**Pipenv** is a package and a virtual environment manager, which uses PIP under the hood. 
It provides more advanced features like version locking and dependency isolation between projects.

To begin with, clone the project in any directory on the disk. Navigate to the project folder. Once we are inside the project folder, execute the following commands to activate the VirtualEnv.
```pipenv shell --python 3.9```

The virtual environment will now be activated, which will provide the required project isolation and version locking.

Next, install all the required dependencies from **Pipfile** using Pipenv as shown.

```pipenv install```
